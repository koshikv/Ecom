# we are create the fixture to avoid the duplication data in test script as soon as we call the setup method then it
# will automatically tur on th driver pytest_addoption(parser) method will get the value from CLI/hooks.and whatever
# the browser we type it will get from CLI
# setup (fixture) method will decide which browser will launch
# browser method (fixture) will return the browser value to setup method (fixture)
# AssertionError means that the assertion is false, and thatâ€™s why the test has failed.
# conftest.py is a special file for pytest where you can add all your test fixtures.
# These fixtures will be visible to all the modules in the same test directory.
# Note: if you are having multiple test packages you can add one conftest.py per package. these files have
# directory scope.
